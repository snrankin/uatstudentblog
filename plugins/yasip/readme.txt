== FAQ==

= The icons are a bit crowded in my sidebar. How do I give them breathing room? =

Open your theme's style.css file, and insert this code (somewhere near the bottom of the file).

.yasip img {
	padding-right: 10px;
}

You can adjust that code to suite your needs, depending on your situation.
