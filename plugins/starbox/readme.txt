Starbox is the Author Box for Humans. Professional Themes to choose from, HTML5, Social Media Profiles, Google Authorship

== Description ==

<h3>Starbox is the Author Box for Humans</h3>

While search engines and other software that read your site care about files like robots.txt, you need Human readers to actually engage with your content and fall in love with it.

Humans look at beauty more than anything else (as you most probably already know, men and women alike). That's why you'll get an <strong>Author Box that's gorgeous to look at and it makes your readers click all the way through</strong> to see more about the Authors.

Now, if you have just yourself as an Author on your site, or a super-star team of Authors, you'll love Starbox, because you can <strong>choose from the professionaly built themes and landscaping</strong>. If you are the super-star type, or want to boost social proof, place your Author Box on top of the page, so that your Human readers will know that they're reading stuff that a real awesome person has written.

You want the classy, bottom-of-the-page Author Box? You can choose that one as well.

And if your star Authors want different things, satisfy their needs, by allowing them to place their Author Box top or bottom, with the default theme, or a better looking one.

The <strong>Social Profiles</strong> of your writers will be obvious and clickable, getting you Humans that will engage with content on your blog and also on your social media streams.

Because your authors are stars or will be very soon, <strong>Google Authorship and Facebook Authorship</strong> are here for them with Starbox, and it's just type->click->boom! to set up. Amazingly easy.

Are you afraid of having to spend time setting Starbox up? Don't worry. You're covered by our "For Humans" guarantee. With NO coding or complicated menus, whatsoever, you'll set your Author Box in a matter of minutes, and since we took a lot of care regarding coding, it will work well and you won't worry about that.

You'll build up some good social proof, you'll give your Human readers the sense of quality and they'll be happy to return for more (which will help you with the search engines who track your site, as well).

If you're doing the tech stuff on your site or want to know what Starbox's inner workings are all about, here's a list:

* HTML 5
* Google Microformats (vCard), to display Rich Snippets in google search results
* Easy to customize for each Author
* You'll get Google Authorship on your hands :-) For all your authors.
* Have it work only on blog posts, only on pages, or both!
* Links to social media profiles of your authors: Facebook, Twitter, Klout, Google+, LinkedIN, Instagram, Flickr, Pinterest, Tumblr, Youtube, Vimeo)
* Each of your Authors can have a different set of social media profiles added
* Links to all the articles
* Section that displays the latest posts of a certain author
* Themes to choose from
* Can set the Name of the Author Box
* Can set Job Title
* Can set Company (with link to company's site)
* Each Author can make the Author Box look like it's his own
* You can choose not to display it for certain authors

* Enables you to upload your own image (so that you won't need a Gravatar)
