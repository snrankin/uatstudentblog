== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my custom fields in the front end? =

Let's consider we have a meta box with the following arguments:
- Meta name: books
- Post Type: post
And we also have two fields defined:
- A text custom field with the Field Title: Book name
- And another text custom field with the Field Title: Author name

You will notice that slugs will automatically be created for the two text fields. For 'Book name' the slug will be 'book-name' and for 'Author name' the slug will be 'author-name'

Let's see what the code for displaying the meta box values in single.php of your theme would be:

`<?php $books = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'books', true ); 
foreach( $books as $book){
	echo $book['book-name'] . '<br/>';
	echo $book['author-name'] . '<br/>';
}?>`

So as you can see the Meta Name 'books' is used as the $key parameter of the function get_post_meta() and the slugs of the text fields are used as keys for the resulting array. Basically CFC stores the entries as custom fields in a multidimensional array. In our case the array would be:

`<?php array( array( "book-name" => "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy", "author-name" => "Douglas Adams" ),  array( "book-name" => "Ender's Game", "author-name" => "Orson Scott Card" ) );?>`

This is true even for single entries.

= How to query by post type in the front-end? =

You can create new queries to display posts from a specific post type. This is done via the 'post_type' parameter to a WP_Query.

Example:

`<?php $args = array( 'post_type' => 'product', 'posts_per_page' => 10 );
$loop = new WP_Query( $args );
while ( $loop->have_posts() ) : $loop->the_post();
	the_title();
	echo '<div class="entry-content">';
	the_content();
	echo '</div>';
endwhile;?>`

This simply loops through the latest 10 product posts and displays the title and content of them. 

= How do I list the taxonomies in the front-end? =

If you want to have a custom list in your theme, then you can pass the taxonomy name into the the_terms() function in the Loop, like so:

`<?php the_terms( $post->ID, 'people', 'People: ', ', ', ' ' ); ?>`

That displays the list of People attached to each post.

= How do I query by taxonomy in the front-end? =

Creating a taxonomy generally automatically creates a special query variable using WP_Query class, which we can use to retrieve posts based on. For example, to pull a list of posts that have 'Bob' as a 'person' taxomony in them, we will use:

`<?php $query = new WP_Query( array( 'person' => 'bob' ) ); ?>`
