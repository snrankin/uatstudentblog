== Description ==

This isn't the typical plugin to create Sliders: Slide Shows, Carousels, Sliders with Posts. This is a Slider with options!
It supports beautiful, responsive image sliders and slide shows. And that's not all - it also can display any regular post in a slider or slide show.
You can even use ATW Show Sliders as a Slide Show replacement for the standard WordPress [gallery] shortcode.

But, best of all, ATW Show Sliders has been designed to give you options! You have more control of what content is displayed in your sliders
and slide shows, as well as how that content is displayed.

This plugin uses the FlexSlider jQuery script for the actual slider animation.

= Slider Options =

and slide shows, as well as how that content is displayed, than any other slider plugin.

= Easy to Select Content =

For images sliders, you can use the standard WordPress gallery generator. Simply add a [gallery] to one
of the new Slider Custom Post types. You can use the standard gallery interface to select images from your
Media library. That interface allows you to add captions, descriptions, even specify the order the images are shown.

ATW Show Sliders requires the Aspen Themeworks Show Posts plugin to specify exactly which posts (or individual images) are used for
sliders you define. You can use the special Slider Post type. You can pick up a gallery from any page. ATW
Show Sliders will even automatically use the first image found on any post. Using the ATW Show Posts filter
interface, you can easily select exactly where your images and posts included in a slider originate.

No other slider makes it as easy to select the source of your images and posts.

= Pro Version Available =

While we think the basic, free version of ATW Show Sliders provides an easy-to-use basic slider with enough options
for many people, we also know that
others want even more control over the appearance of their sliders. So we also offer ATW Show Sliders Pro that has many
more options, including more sizing and layout options; more control over how images are displayed with titles, captions,
and descriptions; support for Videos in sliders, more control of Carousels; selection of over 20 different navigation arrows,
display options for navigation arrows,timing and order options, per-slider custom CSS, and other options
to fine tune your slider. There is no other slider plugin like it.

== Installation ==

Please use the Plugin Add Plugin page to install this plugin.

This plugin REQUIRES the Aspen Themeworks Show Posts plugin to work, and will display an automatic installation choice
if you haven't already installed ATW Show Posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Nothing Happens =

This plugin will not work without the Aspen Theme Works Show Posts plugin.

= Can I put a slider in my header? =

ATW Show Sliders includes an option to make a "banner" slider. If your theme allows adding shortcodes to
the header area, you can use the shortcode to add a banner slider in your header. Otherwise, instructions
are included to add custom code to your theme to support this capability.

= I don't like the way that the slider displays .... whatever. =

ATW Show Sliders Pro offers many more options to control how the slider works and displays content

= What are "Slider Posts"? =

This is a convenience post type that allows you to add slide shows based on the WordPress Gallery tool,
or individual slides (one per Slider Post), grouped together in a "Slider Group". These posts won't
normally appear in the rest of your site.
